    "description": "Hello! I'm Avan Fabian Daniswara, a software engineer and a problem-solver at heart. My journey into technology is driven by a simple belief: the most impactful solutions are born from a deep curiosity about the world around us. Originally from Probolinggo and now an Informatics Engineering student at the State University of Malang, I've always been fascinated by the hidden inefficiencies in everyday life—the challenges people accept simply because \"that's how it's always been done.\" This perspective is my starting point for every project: to look beyond the surface and ask, \"How can technology make this fundamentally better?\" This drive to innovate has led me on an incredible journey. It has guided me in architecting a full-stack platform for a real-world client, developing an award-winning VR/IoT rehabilitation system for a national competition, and building a predictive machine learning model with 85% accuracy. From backend systems in Laravel and AdonisJS to cross-platform mobile apps in Flutter, each project is a testament to my belief in using the right tool for the right problem."
